My name is Mainasara Al-amin Tsowa, I am a software engineer and cybersecurity professional based in *Abuja, Nigeria*.

I am self-admittedly a nerd. I work on many things from Malware, Reverse Engineering, Databases, Networking Tools and Operating Systems, so I am eager to share all of my little adventures on the internet.

This blog aims to bring my uncommitted experimental ideas to the public because I think they are really cool and have to be good for something, right?

## What Is Your Tech Stack?

I mostly work with backend and systems programming languages like

- Go
- C
- C++ (eww)
- Node.js
- Zig
- Gleam
- Python
- Typescript

A lot of them are hobby languages I use sometimes but hey, this is my personal space so I'll tell y'all about every single one.

## That's Good But How Often Will You Be Posting?

Whenever I feel like.

## What Theme Is This?

This blog is built with a slightly modified [Astro Paper Theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)

## Got Any Projects You Are Proud Of?

Yes, I wrote the above heading for a reason.

- [Gecko](https://github.com/neutrino2211/gecko): An experimental systems programming language with strict type-checking and an Object-Oriented paradigm with builtin C interop
- [Nomad](https://github.com/Nomad-Network/nomad): A decentralised database format that aims to be the founding block of community driven decentralised experiences
- [go-option](https://github.com/neutrino2211/go-option): A library that adds Rust-like options to Golang
- [Scryer](https://github.com/neutrino2211/scryer): A network-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
- [NetworkDMZ](https://github.com/neutrino2211/network-dmz): An incident response tool that allows you to shutdown all communication in a network e.g (In case of Malware Infection, push this big red button)
- [EXEPatch](https://github.com/neutrino2211/exe-patch): A red team tool that aims to allow users to create malware payloads that pass as the original programs they are based off of.

Not a project but I am very proud to have [contributed](https://github.com/honojs/create-hono/issues/18) to improving the getting started experience of [create-hono](https://github.com/honojs/create-hono)
