At techxcite24, I gave a talk on the steps one can take to secure themselves online in an ever data-hungry world. The talk boiled down most needs into four broad caricatures which I used to explain the best ways to approach online security.

TLDR

- I am an Instagram user
  > For those that like being public unfiltered figures on the internet, this is for you.
  - Enable two-factor authentication
  - Do not click on weird links
  - Do not join "Honour your parent" trends
  - Do not reply unprompted DMs
  - Do not join "Giveaways"
  - Do not join "free stuff" government programmes
  - Do not buy products from ADS
  
- I am not a criminal
  > "I am not a criminal, why should I care". Privacy is not because you think you are a criminal, it's because you don't want to be labelled a criminal by the powers that be. No worries, I got you covered
  - Try to use password applications
  - Do not interact with unsolicited communication
  - Reject cookies as often as possible
  - Try to use email relay applications
  - Do not use cracked software

- I am serious about this
  > Okay, you want to take security seriously and do your best.
  - Ditch Windows
  - Do not use Google Chrome or Edge
  - Use services like ProtonMail and ProtonVPN
  - Use AD blockers
  - Avoid giving sensitive information to LLMs

- I am not a criminal... I swear
  > You love privacy soo much that you risk looking like a drug dealer.
  - Use the tor browser
  - Use operating systems like Arch or Gentoo
  - Do not sign into Google Search
  - Use LLMs locally via tools like Ollama
  - Use Tails OS for extremely sensitive things
  - Use throwaway email addresses
